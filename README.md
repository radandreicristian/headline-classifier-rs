# Headline Classifier

A simple and powerful end-to-end short text classification project in Rust, using Polars, Candle and Warp.

# Features

- üßò Simple NLP neural network training using ü§ó [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)
- üöÄ CSV I/O and processing with [Polars](https://pola.rs/)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Inference via HTTP with [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp)

# Usage

## Training

To train a model, run the training binary:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin training
```

## Inference

To start the prediction service over HTTP, run the inference binary:

```bash
RUST_LOG=warn cargo run --bin inference
```

Then, to get the predictions, send a request via CURL/Postman:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "blizzard hits southwest"}' http://localhost:3030/predict
```

## Docker
To build and run a Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t "headline-classifier" .; docker run -p 3030:3030 headline-classifier:latest
```
